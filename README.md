# Password-generator
A password generator is a tool or program designed to create strong, random passwords to enhance security. These passwords typically include a combination of letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters, making them difficult to guess or crack. Password generators can be configured to meet specific requirements, such as minimum length and the inclusion of specific character types, to suit various security needs. They are commonly used to improve the security of online accounts, databases, and other systems requiring secure access credentials.
